        For the first time in a while, I took a mini-trip and went back home to Kazakhstan to attend the largest tech conference in Central Asia. I was also a speaker on one of the most anticipated panels at the event, which brought together 4 out of 6 Kazakh YC'!! founders to share their experiences. The room was packed, and the questions from the audience were great‚Äîhuge thanks to one of my investors, Nuradaulet, for organizing the entire panel and finally bringing me to the Astana capital of Kazakhstan. I also met more than 200 high-school kids, students, and other people who want to start a company one day.

        I noticed a lot of patterns among the students and kids I met, and I still see some of them in myself. First off, the talent density among people under 21 in Kazakhstan is insane. I was approached by over 200 people and took more selfies than I see myself in the mirror, so I got to talk to everyone. Special shoutout to NIS, FixMat, and NSPM (PHMATH). For those who don't know, those schools are considered the most cracked in Kazakhstan.

        Back in my high school, almost no one knew what a startup was or why programming mattered beyond getting a job at Google. Most people thought I'd end up as a tech bro. What really stood out at these schools, though, is their communities dedicated to startups and entrepreneurship. For example, NIS has several founder communities and one big community called "NIS Valley üöÄ".

        I'm writing this to address the most common patterns and questions I heard from students across those schools and during the conference.
